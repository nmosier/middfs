middfs TODO

TASKS

DONE
[X] Do not mount mirror by default.
[X] Specify user directory name as command-line argument.
[X] Rewrite file ops to use middfs_rsrc as file handle.
[X] Transition middfs-client-rsrc.[ch] to being shared code
    [X] Embed middfs_rsrc struct in middfs_request struct
[X] Write serialization functions
[X] Delete MFD_SREQ

CURRENT
[ ] get middfs_read() working with local/network.

TODO
[X] extricate server-dependent functionality from lib/conn.[ch]
[X] get client "request listener" up and running
[X] migrate to FUSE 1
[ ] configuration file to store vars including: (*) client name,
    (*) server address, etc.
[ ] sockinfos to linked list
[ ] server responds with actual username of client
    (resolves naming conflicts)
[ ] define new response type that notifies the requester that the
    other client is not online.
[ ] factor out identical code in handle_request_{read,write} functions
[ ] Add code in client_rsrc_create() to open a network socket if the resource resides on the net.
[ ] Handle case when server receives a request but named client is not online.

BUGS
[ ] (SERVER) double free on receipt of quick successive write requests
[ ] (SERVER) socket entries not being deleted for writes
[ ] (CLIENT) assertion fail on receipt of quick successive write requests
[ ] (CLIENT) sufficiently large read requests hang, perhaps because the responding
             client doesn't send all the bytes at once
[ ] (CLIENT) ``address already in use'' bug -- sends connectin packet anyway

client dir (static, local) vs. client name (determined by server
upon connecting)
