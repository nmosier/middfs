TASKS

DONE
[X] Do not mount mirror by default.
[X] Specify user directory name as command-line argument.
[X] Rewrite file ops to use middfs_rsrc as file handle.

TODO
[ ] Automated tests
[ ] Write middfs_rsrc_open() function for opening resource
    (would involve opening a file descriptor (local) and socket
    (network))
[ ] Check if file is on local disk; if not, ping server for file.
[ ] Write basic server that handles requests and returns a dummy
    file.
[ ] Design a basic packet format for client<->server communication.
[ ] Maintain configuration directory in ~/.middfs-d and config
    file in ~/.middfs-d/middfs.conf.
[ ] Use mount(2)/umount(2) system calls instead of calling system(3).

client dir (static, local) vs. client name (determined by server
upon connecting)
